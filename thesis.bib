abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

abstract = {A c hanging scene may be observed via a sequence of images. One might learn a golf swing by observing the motions of an expert with a video camera, or better understand root growth by observing the root using many images taken hours apart. Action phenomena observed over time can be due to the motion of objects or the observer or both. Changes in an im-age sequence provide features for detecting objects that are moving or for computing their trajectories. In case the viewer is moving through a relatively static world, image changes allow for computing the motion of the viewer in the world. Similarly changing pixels in an image provide an important feature for object detection and recognition. Motion can reveal the shape of an object as well as other characteristics, such as speed or function. Analysis of object motion over time may be the ultimate goal, for instance in controlling trac ow or in analyzing the gait of a person with a new prosthesis. Today, a h uge amount of videos are made to record events and structure of the world. It is necessary to have methods of segmenting these image sequences into meaningful events or scenes for easy access, analysis or editing. This chapter concentrates on detection of motion from 2D images and video sequences and the image analysis used to extract features. Methods for solution of the above applicaton problems are discussed. Analysis of 3D structure and motion derived from 2D images is discussed in Chapter 13.},

abstract = {Recent state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mostly based on deep neural networks, thanks to their high performance and fast computation time. However, these methods are usually trained in a supervised manner, which requires large number of high quality ground-truth segmentation masks. On the other hand, classical image segmentation approaches such as level-set methods are formulated in a self-supervised manner by minimizing energy functions such as Mumford-Shah functional, so they are still useful to help generate segmentation masks without labels. Unfortunately, these algorithms are usually computationally expensive and often have limitation in semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function based on Mumford-Shah functional that can be used in deep-learning based image segmentation without or with small labeled data. This loss function is based on the observation that the softmax layer of deep neural networks has striking similarity to the characteristic function in the Mumford-Shah functional. We show that the new loss function enables semi-supervised and unsupervised segmentation. In addition, our loss function can also be used as a regularized function to enhance supervised semantic segmentation algorithms. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

@article{Buda1992,
abstract = {Chirality is a property that is independent of its physical and chemical manifestations. It is therefore possible to quantify chirality without any reference to pseudoscalar observables. In this paper we propose a new measure of chirality that is based on Hausdorff s concept of distances between sets and that is a natural choice as a measure for molecular models that represent structures as sets of atomic coordinates. This Hausdorff chirality measure, a continuous and similarity-invariant function of an object's shape, is zero if and only if the object is achiral. We have applied this measure to study the chirality of tetrahedral shapes—classical models of tetracoordinate carbon atoms—and have identified the extremal (most chiral) shapes for every chiral subsymmetry of Td that can be realized by a tetrahedron. Our calculations show that the degree of chirality of the extremal objects increases with a decrease in symmetry, although the most symmetric chiral tetrahedron, with D2 symmetry, already possesses 87{\%} of the maximal chirality value available for tetrahedra, and that the shape of the most chiral tetrahedron, with C1 symmetry, is very close to that of the most chiral C2 tetrahedron. The properties and the applicability of the Hausdorff chirality measure are compared with those of other measures of chirality that are based on common-volume or root-mean-square approaches. {\textcopyright} 1992, American Chemical Society.

@inproceedings{Zhang2018,
abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in a variety of applications across many disciplines. Yet, their superior performance comes with the expensive cost of requiring correctly annotated large-scale datasets. Moreover, due to DNNs' rich capacity, errors in training labels can hamper performance. To combat this problem, mean absolute error (MAE) has recently been proposed as a noise-robust alternative to the commonly-used categorical cross entropy (CCE) loss. However, as we show in this paper, MAE can perform poorly with DNNs and challenging datasets. Here, we present a theoretically grounded set of noise-robust loss functions that can be seen as a generalization of MAE and CCE. Proposed loss functions can be readily applied with any existing DNN architecture and algorithm, while yielding good performance in a wide range of noisy label scenarios. We report results from experiments conducted with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and FASHION-MNIST datasets and synthetically generated noisy labels.},

@article{Thada2013,
abstract = {A similarity coefficient represents the similarity between two documents, two queries, or one document and one query. The retrieved documents can also be ranked in the order of presumed importance. A similarity coefficient is a function which computes the degree of similarity between a pair of text objects. There are a large number of similarity coefficients proposed in the literature, because the best similarity measure doesn't exist (yet !). In this paper we do a comparative analysis for finding out the most relevant document for the given set of keyword by using three similarity coefficients viz Jaccard, Dice and Cosine coefficients. This we perform using genetic algorithm approach. Due to the randomized nature of genetic algorithm the best fitness value is the average of 10 runs of the same code for a fixed number of iterations.The similarity coefficient for a set of documents retrieved for a given query from Google are find out then average relevancy in terms of fitness values using similarity coefficients is calculated. In this paper we have averaged 10 different generations for each query by running the program 10 times for the fixed value of Probability of Crossover Pc=0.7 and Probability of Mutation Pm=0.01. The same experiment was conducted for 10 queries.},
