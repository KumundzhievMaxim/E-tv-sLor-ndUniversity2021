The results reported are calculated over the dedicated testing set of $60$ scans. It was measured metrics, $Id rate$, $mean localization distance$ and $standard deviation (std) distance$. $Id rate$ is the percentage of the centroid estimations predicted which are closest to the correct ground truth vertebra centroid (and are less than $20mm$ from that centroid). $Mean$ and $Std$ relate to the localization error distance between the predicted centroid positions and the ground-truth centroid positions for the same vertebrae (if it occurs at the scan). 

Table \ref{results_table} represents a performance of the method.
It performs slightly worse on the Id rate. A possible reason for this is that our method relies on the ordering of vertebrae and sufficient contextual information to localize in a dense regression identification stage, but it does not explicitly classify vertebrae, for example, using categorical cross entropy.

The advantage of the method is that it is lightweight and fast both in training time, models took $> 11 hours$ (detection model) and $> 7 hours$ (identification model) to train, but also at test time, with predictions for a scan being computed on average in $40 seconds$. The method does not rely on an iterative stage and usage of RNN, thus making the method likely more efficient at test time.
