Accordingly  accomplished and presented job within the thesis work I consider that CNNs effectively cope with extracting the features of vertebral samples by leveraging the domain information contained in certain vertebrae scans.

The two stage CNN pipeline which initially detect vertebrae then identify specific vertebrae keening with a 2-class cross entropy loss and L1 loss accordingly outcomes spectacular results for vertebrae segmentation problem on a publicly available pathological spine CT data set. The full project codebase within the step-wise instructions is hosted at the author's github repository \footnote{ \url{https://github.com/KumundzhievMaxim/VertebraeSegmentation}}
