\subsection{Dataset}
The database which were used for experiments is a public database provided by the Bio-Media research group. The database consists of spine-focused (i.e. tightly cropped) CT scans of $125$ patients with varying types of pathologies. For most patients, multiple scans from longitudinal examinations are available, resulting in overall $242$ scans in the database. For each scan, manual annotations of vertebrae centroids are provided. The dataset was represented as split of a dedicated training set of $242$ scans and a dedicated test set of $60$ scans. It is comprised of pathological, arbitrary FoV scans. The scans were re-sampled at $1mm x 1mm x 1mm$ resolution, thereby every pixel in the samples was generated from the scans represents a $1mm$ cubed section of the body.

\subsection{Machine}
It was used the local machine Machine with 2,2 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4 of RAM and Radeon Pro 555X 4 GB
Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB Graphics to conduct the experiments. Source code for this project is available on GitHub which can be used to reproduce the achieved results.
