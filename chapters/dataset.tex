%TODO change
The data set consists of spine-focused CT scans of 125 patients with varying types of pathologies. 

In the case of the detection model the dense labelling contains two values: 0 representing background and 1 representing vertebrae. 

The identification modelâ€™s dense labelling contains values from 0 to 26. Whilst 0 representing background, 1 representing C1 vertebrae up to 26 representing S2 vertebrae.

Note: The size of the sample is 8 x 80 x 320, if the original scan is not larger enough to fill those dimensions some padding is added, as can be seen at the top.}
